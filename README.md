🔢 Faulty Calculator
A fun JavaScript project with a 10% twist!

✅ Overview
This is not your ordinary calculator!
It performs standard arithmetic operations but with a 10% probability of giving a wrong result by adding random noise (±10%).

Why?
To simulate real-world scenarios where sensors or machines introduce errors and to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and randomization techniques.
